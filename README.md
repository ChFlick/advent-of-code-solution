# Advent of Code solutions

Solutions to Advent of Code problems (2021) in TypeScript.

Including a small website built around it to show and execute the solutions and run a benchmark.

In the future I plan to add visualizations for the solutions, a source-code viewer, and maybe a way to compare solutions.
I'd also like to add some solutions in webassembly.

The site is based on [vitesse-lite](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-lite/), though I threw out UnoCSS .
